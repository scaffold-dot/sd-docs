# Welcome to Scaffold-DOT Documentation

We're excited to announce the official documentation for **Scaffold-DOT**!

<!-- truncate -->

## What is Scaffold-DOT?

Scaffold-DOT is an open-source toolkit for building decentralized applications on Polkadot Hub blockchain with Solidity smart contracts. It's a fork of the popular Scaffold-ETH 2, adapted for Polkadot's Asset Hub using the PolkaVM execution environment.

## Why Scaffold-DOT?

If you're familiar with Ethereum development but want to build on Polkadot, Scaffold-DOT is the perfect bridge:

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts as you edit contracts
- 🪝 **Custom React Hooks**: Simplified smart contract interactions with TypeScript
- 🧱 **Web3 Components**: Pre-built UI components for common dapp patterns
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet**: Quick testing with local faucet
- 🔐 **Multiple Wallets**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, email, social login, and 700+ wallets

## Getting Started
